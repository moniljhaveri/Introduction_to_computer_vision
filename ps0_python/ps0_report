### Introduction to Computer Vision 
#### HW #1

1. Problem 1 
	d. I expect the green channel to be better to do computer vision processing on because it seemed to have higher more data in the picture. The contrast seemed to be higher between the light areas and the dark areas. That should make edge detection easier.  
2. Problem 4 
	a. 
	1. Maximum Pixel: 255
	 2. Minimum Pixel: 9 
	3.  Mean Pixel: 114.292
	4.  Standard Deviation Pixel: 55.397
	5. These were computed used numpy operations. 

	d. The negative values are values that are the absence of an value. It means that the the shifted values are higher than the original values 

3. Problem 
	b.  sigma = 16 
	c. The blue verision looks better, the blue is much more subtle for the same amount of sigma
